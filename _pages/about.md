# About Me
* I am a Ph.D. student at the Queensland University of Technology, advised by Prof. [Sridha Sridharan](https://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/s.sridharan) and Prof. [Clinton Fookes](https://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/c.fookes). My project is in collaboration with [CSIRO Robotics](https://research.csiro.au/robotics/), advised by Dr. [Peyman Moghadam](https://people.csiro.au/m/p/peyman-moghadam).
* During my Ph.D., I interned (twice) at The Australian Institute for Machine Learning, advised by Prof. [Simon Lucey](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=vmAe35UAAAAJ&hl=en). 
* My research interests lie in the general area of robotic vision and scene understanding. My Ph.D. work mainly focuses on utilizing geometric and temporal priors that are abundant in the context of mobile robotics.
