## About Me
* I am a PhD student at the Queensland University of Technology, advised by Prof. [Sridha Sridharan](https://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/s.sridharan) and Prof. [Clinton Fookes](https://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/c.fookes). My project is in collaboration with [CSIRO Robotics](https://research.csiro.au/robotics/), advised by Dr. [Peyman Moghadam](https://people.csiro.au/m/p/peyman-moghadam). During my PhD, I interned (twice) at The Australian Institute for Machine Learning, advised by Prof. [Simon Lucey](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=vmAe35UAAAAJ&hl=en). 
* My PhD thesis has been accepted for graduation and my conferral will be in December, 2024. I am currently working as a Research Assitant at QUT and a Visiting Researcher at AIML. 
* My research interests lie in the general area of robotic vision and scene understanding. My PhD work mainly focused on utilizing geometric and temporal priors for solving 3D data association problems. At the moment I am studying recent advances in neural representations through the lens of classical signal processing concepts.
